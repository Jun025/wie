# LGT / ez-i Java-app ABI

Reverse-engineered ABI for running an **AOT-compiled LGT Java app** (ez-i / Xceed
toolchain) on wie's JVM. Each Java class is emitted as a native ARM record: methods
are real ARM code in `.text`, class/field/method metadata lives in `.data`. The app
talks to the platform through the "java-interface" import module (table `0x64`).

Scope: the PoC lives entirely in `wie_lgt` (`LgtJvmShared`, LGT-specific per #1232);
shared `wie_midp` / `wie_wipi_java` classes are **not** modified. This document is the
consolidated ABI; see `docs/lgt_native_classes.md` for the byte-level descriptor RE.
The `cpNN` tags below mark the reverse-engineering milestone each fact was pinned at.

Notation: addresses are from the ez-i reference app (`.text` `0x1000..0xe7800`,
`.data` `0x1400000..`, `.bss` `0x1500000..`). Anything not pinned by RE is labelled
**(추정)**.

## 1. Module / SVC layout

The native code reaches the platform two ways: **import thunks** (16-byte stubs that
trap into wie via SVC) and **trampolines** (per-method SVC stubs wie installs into the
vtables). wie routes everything through SVC categories (`wie_lgt/src/runtime.rs`):

| category | id | handler | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SVC_CATEGORY_INIT` | 1 | `init.rs` | boot imports (`java_unk0/5/9/11/12`, `load_classes`, `new`, `0x54`) |
| `SVC_CATEGORY_WIPIC` | 3 | `wipi_c.rs` | WIPI-C clet ABI (framebuffer/graphics) — used by the clet path |
| `SVC_CATEGORY_STDLIB` | 5 | `stdlib.rs` | libc-ish (`strcpy`, `memcpy`, `time`, …) + native `new` (`0x32`) |
| `SVC_CATEGORY_JAVA_TRAMPOLINE` | 7 | `native_jvm.rs` | per-method vtable/static stubs → JVM invoke |
| `SVC_CATEGORY_JAVA_INTERFACE` | 9 | `java/interface.rs` | java-interface imports routed by index (the SVC id **is** the import index) |

### Import thunk format (16 bytes, in `.text`)

```
str  lr, [sp, #-4]!     ; save return
bl   <dispatcher>       ; 0xe31a8 (resolves index, traps to platform)
.word <table>           ; table id (1 = stdlib, 0x64 = java-interface)
.word <index>           ; function index within the table
```

The dispatcher (`0xe31a8`) reads the index word that follows the `bl` and returns to
the caller via the saved `ip` after the platform call. wie resolves a thunk on first
use via `get_import_table(0x64)` / `get_import_function(0x64, <index>)`
(`init.rs`), which hands back the SVC stub for that index. Example: the thunk at
`0xe2c50` has `.word 1, .word 0x32` ⇒ the stdlib **`new`** primitive — so an app call
that `bx`-es to `0xe2c50` is allocating an object.

---

## 2. Native class descriptor format

(Full RE in `docs/lgt_native_classes.md`; mirrored by `native_class.rs`. 283/283
method code pointers validated inside `.text`.)

```
Class header (at H):
  +0x00  tag           (0x21 / 0x31 observed)
  +0x08  ptr_name      -> cstring (obfuscated single letters: "Game", "a", "o", "i", …)
  +0x10  ptr_parent    -> platform class-name cstring, OR another class header H'
  +0x18  access_flags  (java access bits | 0x20000 app marker)
  +0x38  ptr_methods   -> [count:u32, MethodRecord[count]]
  +0x3c  ptr_fields    -> [count:u32, FieldRecord[count]]

Class handle (at H + 0x4c): { 0, 0, H }    <- every member's ptr_class points here,
                                              i.e. handle indirection: record -> handle -> header

MethodRecord (28 bytes):
  +0x00 ptr_class(=handle)  +0x04 ptr_name   +0x08 ptr_signature
  +0x0c access_flags        +0x10 num_locals +0x14 code_ptr(-> .text)   +0x18 unk

FieldRecord (20 bytes):
  +0x00 ptr_class(=handle)  +0x04 ptr_name   +0x08 ptr_type
  +0x0c access_flags        +0x10 index      (declared index within the class)
```

**Class handle indirection**: members carry `ptr_class = H + 0x4c` (the handle), not
`H`. The handle's `+0x08` points back to `H`. `getInstance` and singleton lookups take
a handle and resolve `handle → header → name` (`parse_native_class_from_handle`).

### App class graph (reference app, from `.data` scan)

```
Jlet (platform)
  └─ a            (a.run @0x1f10, a.startApp @0x1ad8, a.b(Lo;I)V @0x2200)
       └─ Game    (Game.a @0x11dc data-load, Game.b @0x1484)
org/kwis/msp/lcdui/Card (platform)
  └─ o
       ├─ d, e, j, l
       └─ b └─ i
```
Class `a`'s descriptor handle = `0x1400df4` (header `0x1400da8`).

---

## 3. Boot sequence

`get_java_interface_method` (`interface.rs`) maps the boot imports; the app drives them
in order during startup:

| import | wie fn | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x03` | `java_unk0` | register main-class metadata `(name="Game", _, flag="true")` |
| `0x07` | `java_unk5` | register the app's OWN native classes (handle array @ a0) |
| `0x06` | `java_unk12` | paired with `0x07` (same struct ptr) — role unconfirmed (추정) |
| `0x14` | `java_load_classes` | declare IMPORTED platform classes + resolve dispatch offsets (see §4) |
| `0x82` | `java_unk9` | boot hook, arg always 0 (추정: lifecycle marker) |
| `0x83` | `java_unk11` | invoke-static `org/kwis/msp/lcdui/Main.main(argv)`, `argv[0]="Game"` |
| `0x0f` | `JavaNewObject` | native object allocator (`obj = 0xf(...); obj.<init>()`) |
| `0x54` | `java_interface_unk84` | per-method entry helper (stack/safepoint check) — no-op (추정) |

`0x83` boots the app's Jlet through the **shared lcdui Main path**
(`invoke_lcdui_main(jvm, "Game")`), identical to the WIPI-C clet boot
(`net/wie/CletWrapper`). That wraps `Game` in `WIPIMIDlet`, creates `net.wie.CardCanvas`,
and `Display.setCurrent(CardCanvas)` — so wie's MIDP paint loop begins ticking (empty)
from here.

---

## 4. Global virtual dispatch (two-level vtable, reserved slot 0)

`java_load_classes` (`0x14`) hands the platform parallel arrays describing imported
classes and the method/field refs they use. `install_platform_tables` builds the
dispatch tables the AOT code reads.

**AOT virtual call shape:**
```
idx = virtual_method_offsets[ref]      ; u16 logical index
bx   vtable[idx + 1]                   ; ldr ip,[r3, #4] after add r3,r3,idx<<2
```
The `+1` (`ldr ip,[r3,#4]`) means **physical slot 0 is reserved** and methods start at
slot 1. wie therefore:

- allocates `global_vtable` of `VTABLE_REFS+1 = 129` words (`VTABLE_REFS = 128`),
- for each method-ref `r` with a real `(...)`-signature: installs a trampoline at
  **physical slot `r+1`** and sets `virtual_method_offsets[r] = r` (the logical index),
- so `vtable[offset[r] + 1] = vtable[r + 1]` dispatches ref `r` correctly.

Verified by RE: pre-fix, `AnnunciatorComponent.show@ref6` misrouted to `vtable[7]` =
`File.read`; the reserved-slot-0 fix corrected it (cp15). Every object's `+0x00` word
points at `global_vtable` (app objects and platform proxies alike).

### Per-class override vtables

A few `java/lang` classes are dispatched by the AOT at **hardcoded physical slots**
that collide with the global identity table. For those, wie copies the global vtable
and overrides the known slots (`known_java_lang_vtable`), storing the result in
`class_vtables[name]`; `bind_pending` repoints the object's `+0x00` to it once the
class is known. Indices are **physical** (reserved slot already baked in):

| class | physical slot → method |
|---|---|
| `java/lang/Runtime` | 13 → `freeMemory()J`, 14 → `gc()V` |
| `java/lang/StringBuffer` | 5 → `toString()`, 19 → `append(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;` |
| `java/lang/Thread` | 11 → `start()V` |
| `java/lang/String` | 35 → `toCharArray()[C` (cp30) |

(These slots are empirically identified — **추정** where not cross-checked against a
second call site. Runtime/StringBuffer/Thread are all confirmed by a
working call.)

### Static methods / fields

Per imported class, static methods get **direct** trampoline pointers written into
`static_method_offsets[smo+j]`; static-field slots get an identity fill into
`field_offsets[sfo+j]`.

---

## 5. Instance object model + field layout

```
guest object block (alloc_native_object / native `new`):
  +0x00  vtable word      -> global_vtable (or a per-class override after <init>)
  +0x04  0
  +0x08  ptr_fields       -> field array (256 words, zeroed)
```

`OBJ_HEADER_SIZE = 0x0c`, `OBJ_PTR_FIELDS_OFFSET = 0x08`, `FIELD_ARRAY_WORDS = 256`.

**Instance field addressing** (AOT): `obj.field[ field_offsets[K] ]`. Left all-zero,
every field-ref aliases slot 0 (this broke `a.startApp`'s "is Display set?" gate —
cp16/cp17). wie computes an **inheritance-aware, inherited-first flat layout**:

> object slot = (count of fields in all app-ancestor classes) + declared field index

Platform ancestors contribute 0 fields to the guest layout (their state lives on the
JVM side). `register_app_classes` computes each class's `(name, type, slot)` list into
`app_field_layouts`; `install_platform_tables` then segments the flat `fields` ref
array by matching each window to a class's exact field set and writes the resolved slot
into `field_offsets[k]`. Field-record parse offsets: name `+0x04`, type `+0x08`,
declared index `+0x10` (all 150 reference-app fields matched after fixing an initial
`+0x00` vs `+0x04` off-by-4).

### Object binding lifecycle

- `new` (stdlib `0x32` / java `0xf`) → `alloc_native_object`: allocates the block with
  the **global** vtable word, inserts the ptr into `pending_new` (**unbound** — no JVM
  class yet).
- The `<init>` trampoline calls `bind_pending(ptr, class_name)`: removes it from
  `pending_new`, repoints `+0x00` to a per-class vtable if one exists, resolves the
  class, and creates the instance. App classes reuse the guest block as an
  `LgtClassInstance`; platform classes are instantiated by the JVM keyed on the ptr.
- `getInstance` (java-interface `0xc`) → `singleton_instance(class_handle)`: cached;
  resolves handle → name, instantiates a bound app instance, returns its guest ptr.
  Must be stable across calls/threads (per-class state like `a.run`'s run-flag at
  `obj+0x20` is shared through it — cp20).

> Roadmap — field unification: an `LgtClassInstance`'s JVM-side fields and the guest
> field array at `guest_ptr` are currently separate stores. They should be unified so a

## 6. java-interface import table (status)

The SVC id **is** the import index. Implemented imports get a real handler; everything
else is logged and returns 0. Three tiers:

### Implemented

| idx | name | semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `0x9` | String factory | `(ctx, utf16_ptr, count, out_slot)` → materialise `java/lang/String` from constant-pool UTF-16, return a guest ptr bound to it (cp10) |
| `0xc` | `getInstance(handle)` | canonical singleton instance for a class handle (cp20) |
| `0xf` | native `new` | allocate guest object; `<init>` binds it (cp8) |
| `0x54` | method-entry helper | resolved first in every native method with a small constant — stack/safepoint check (추정), no-op |
| boot: `0x03 0x06 0x07 0x14 0x82 0x83` | see §3 | |

### No-op-safe (evidence-identified primitives; documented no-ops)

These are called with shapes consistent with GC / safepoint / exception / sync
bookkeeping; leaving them as `→ 0` has caused no regression across full boot + setup.

| idx | observed args | likely role (추정) |
|---|---|---|
| `0x12` | `(0, 0, sp)` | stack-ptr only — safepoint/exception frame |
| `0x1f` | `(0, obj/type, count)` | type/count — GC root or array bookkeeping |
| `0x21` | `(obj, 0, sp)` **and** `(new_obj, …)` | register/track object (see §7 — driver path uses this) |
| `0x22` | `(0, n, …)` | small ints — counter/flag |
| `0xb`,`0xd` | `(handle, …)` pair | per-class bookkeeping invoked inside helper `0x1908` (36× each) |

> Note: `0x21` is listed here because its *common* uses are benign object tracking, but
> it is **also** on the render-driver registration path (§7) where a no-op is *not*
> sufficient. The distinction is the call site, not the index.

### Unresolved — render driver (needs ez-i ABI; see §7)

| idx | observed | blocker |
|---|---|---|
| `0x55` | `(a-singleton, code@0x1ad4, 0)` / `(0,4,8)` (overloaded) | registers app "carried code"; replaying it is inert (cp23) |
| `0x56` | `(this, code@0x1ad4, 0)` | registers app callback/code |
| `0x57` | `(this, …)` in `a.b(Lo;I)V` | called once at setup; a0 = app `this`, not a card (cp25) |
| `0x21` (driver use) | `(new_obj, …)` in `a.run` and `a.b` | hands an **unbound** native object to the platform |

---

## 7. Render model + the one open question

### What the WIPI render model says (public)

- `DisplayProxy.flush()` / `flush(x,y,w,h)` blits a double-buffered back-buffer to
  screen; `isDoubleBuffered()` exists.
- `org.kwis.msp.lcdui.EventDispatcher` (`DisplayProxy.evtDisp`) drives the tick.
- WIPI-C clet: the platform calls `paintClet(x,y,w,h)` per frame. Java equivalent =
  the displayable's per-frame paint + flush.
- wie already drives WIPI-C clets; `CardCanvas.paint` already loops every frame.

### What the reference app actually does (RE, cp21–cp25)

- The app does **not** use `pushCard`/`CardCanvas` normally. It runs full setup
  (data load → 240×320 back-buffer → `getGraphics` → Cards/RNG/Thread) and then **0
  draw calls** are issued.
- `a.run` (the game thread's `run`) is a **confirmed one-shot**: `getInstance(0xe)` →
  helper → check `obj.field[8]` → `0x55(obj)`, `0x56(this)`, `0x1f(0)`, then **returns**
  via the epilogue at `0x2140`. No frame loop inside it.
- `a.b(Lo;I)V` runs **once** at setup: `new(0x32)` → bare object `r4`; `0x57(a0=this)`;
  `0x21(a0=r4)`. The "helper" `0xe2c50` is itself the `new` import thunk.
- The object handed to `0x21` (the render driver / "card") comes straight from `new`:
  it has only the **global vtable word**, is in `pending_new`, and has **no `<init>`**
  before registration ⇒ **no JVM class, no descriptor, no per-class vtable**.

### Why this is blocked

P4 (static-type identification) has nothing to latch onto: the registered object is an
opaque ez-i-native handle with **no bound per-frame method to call**. The per-frame
invocation is the **ez-i runtime's** job — its event loop calls the registered native
object's paint entry each frame — and wie does not emulate that loop (replaying the
carried code `0x55/0x56` is inert, cp23). The app registers nothing into wie's MIDP
card system, so there is no safe wie-side connection point. Calling any native vtable
slot here would be a guess (forbidden).

**cp26 — the app `Card.paint` path is reachable but empty (experiment, reverted).**
The app's `Card` subclasses *are* known JVM classes: `o` (extends
`org/kwis/msp/lcdui/Card`) has a real `paint(Lorg/kwis/msp/lcdui/Graphics;)V`
(`@0xd8d70`, draws on its Graphics arg), inherited by `d`/`e`/`j`/`l`, and each is
created as a bound singleton via `getInstance` (`0xc`). A one-shot experiment pushed the
bound `o`-card into wie's `Display`/`CardCanvas`: **`o.paint` then ticked every frame on
the back-buffer** (the Card.paint path wires cleanly into wie's existing tick) — but
issued **zero draw calls**. `o.paint` ran without error and made no `Graphics`/draw
calls at all, i.e. it took its empty-state early-out. Root cause is the same wall: the
`getInstance` singletons are **empty shells** (zeroed fields); the live title-screen
state lives in the ez-i-native (unbound) objects, not in the JVM-bound cards. So
correctly ticking `Card.paint` still paints nothing. This **excludes the app
`Card.paint` instance path** and re-points at the same missing piece below.

**cp27 — render-field provenance, traced (diagnosis only).** cp26's "empty shell" was
an inference from `g==0`; cp27 traced the actual writer of the one field that gates
`o.paint`, to classify the wall as app-side (fixable) vs platform-side (maintainer).

- *Gate field S.* `o.paint` (`@0xd8d70`) early-outs on `bl 0xd8640` → `getInstance(o)`
  (`0xd85e4`, import idx `0xc`, confirmed) returning the **o class singleton**; the gate
  is that singleton's guest field-array slot 6 (`[obj+8][+0x18]`) = **`o.g : I`** (int,
  declared index 6; `o` extends the platform `Card`, so slot = declared index). The gate
  is the *class singleton*, not `this`.
- *Writers of `o.g`.* Found in the app ARM — both inside one method, **`o.k()V`
  (`@0xda7f8`)**: `0xda8a0` writes `g ← 0` (reset), `0xdb240` writes `g ← 1` (set, from a
  literal). Both reach the singleton via `bl 0xd8640` (`getInstance(o)`), i.e. they write
  **the same singleton and the same guest field-array store that `o.paint` reads**. No
  JVM-side writer exists (the AOT writes its own fields with ARM `str`, not a JVM
  putfield). Data source is a literal `0/1` (a game state flag — not a `.dat` load, not a
  native-import return).
- *Instance identity.* gate object = writer target = the instance cp26 pushed = the
  `getInstance(o)` singleton (`0x48840130`) — all the same. The unbound native objects
  carried by `0x21`/`0x57` are separate, but `o.paint` never reads them (it gates on the
  class singleton).
- *Why `o.g` stays 0.* `o.k()V` (the writer) is a **virtual method with no static call
  site** (no `bl 0xda7f8`, no pointer-word ref anywhere in `.text`) — it is only reachable
  via the two-level vtable dispatch, i.e. called by the game's state machine each
  frame/step. In the reachable run only `o.paint` is dispatched on `o`; `o.k` never runs,
  so `g` is never set.

**Classification — platform-side (§7), now traced, not inferred.** The wall is *not* a
field-store split (§5: writer and reader use the same guest array) and *not* an
instance mis-pick (cp26 pushed the very singleton `o.paint` gates on). The `o.g` writer
exists and targets the right store/instance; it just never runs, because the virtual
`o.k()V` that holds it is driven by the game state machine, which only advances under a
per-frame tick. That tick is the ez-i runtime's job — the same missing piece below.
So **field unification (§5) and "find the live instance" are *not* fixes** for the title
render; the one missing thing remains the ez-i per-frame drive.

**cp28 — force `o.g = 1`: the render path works end-to-end (experiment, reverted).**
A one-shot surgical probe pushed the `o`-singleton into wie's tick (cp26 wiring) and
wrote `1` into its gate slot (`[obj+8][+0x18]`, the `o.g` cp27 traced). Result:
`o.paint` **passed the early-out and drew on the back-buffer** — 39 real draw calls
(**21× `Graphics.setColor`, 18× `Graphics.fillRect`**) through wie's standard paint
event (`Display.handlePaintEvent → CardCanvas.handlePaintEvent(Graphics) → o.paint`),
which presents the buffer to the screen. This **proves `o.g` is the genuine render gate
and the whole render path (gate → `o.paint` → `Graphics` → back-buffer → flush) works**;
the only thing missing for those draws is *setting `o.g`* (i.e. running the virtual
`o.k()V`, i.e. the ez-i per-frame drive).
Caveat: `o.paint` did not run to completion — after the 39 draws it hit a *separate*
`NoSuchMethodError: java/lang/String.e()V` (diagnosed in cp29 below — **not** a second
empty-state field gate; draws did occur). The draws are background/box fills
(`fillRect`), not yet the title sprite/text (`drawImage`/`drawString`), consistent with
`o.paint` aborting partway. Experiment reverted (force-g=1 is a test hook, not a fix);
only the finding is recorded.

**cp29 — the `String.e()V` abort is an ez-i `java/lang/String` vtable slot (platform,
STOP).** Traced the cp28 caveat under the same harness. The receiver is a *genuine*
`java/lang/String` (`"LOADING..."`, just made by the String factory): a draw-text
wrapper `B(Graphics, String)` (`@0x100d8`) does `setColor` → `s.vtable[slot 35]()` →
draw. So the String is the intended argument, **not** a mis-bound app object. The crash
is that the app calls `java/lang/String`'s hardcoded **physical vtable slot 35**
(ref 34), but the app's import data declares `java/lang/String` with **`vmc=0`** (zero
imported virtual methods) — so wie has no per-class String vtable and the global slot 35
holds an unrelated *app* method (`e()V`), giving `String.e()` → `NoSuchMethodError`.
The correct slot-35 method is an entry of **ez-i's own `java/lang/String` vtable**, which
is **not present in the app binary** (`vmc=0`; ez-i provides it). This is the same shape
as the `java/lang/*` per-class vtables (Runtime/StringBuffer/Thread, cp4–6/cp10).
cp29 initially over-classified this as maintainer-gated from a single call site; cp30
corrected and resolved it by RE.

**cp30 — String physical slot 35 = `toCharArray()[C`, RE-confirmed (fix).** Fully
disassembling the draw-text wrapper `B(Graphics, String)` (`@0x100d8`) and its draw
helper (`@0x10228`): `B` calls `s.vtable[35]()` (no args) and the helper then iterates
the result `r` as a char array — `data = [r+8]; len = [data]; for i in 0..len { char =
[data + 4 + i*2] }` (a per-char glyph loop, bitmap font). The only no-arg, char-array-
returning String method is **`toCharArray()[C`**. Added as a per-class String override
(physical slot 35) in `known_java_lang_vtable`. Behaviour-confirmed under the force-g=1
harness: `String.e()V NoSuchMethodError` is **gone**, `String.toCharArray()[C` is now
dispatched at that call site, and `o.paint` runs **without fatal** (cp28 aborted there).
So the platform-side mis-classification was wrong; this was an ordinary `java/lang/*`
vtable slot, RE'd like the others.

**cp31 — char-array guest marshalling (fix), but the glyph loop is gated elsewhere.**
The glyph loop reads a `char[]` as `data = [arr+8]; len = [data]; char = [data+4+i*2]`
(u16 LE). wie marshalled the `toCharArray` result via `register_platform_object`, whose
proxy has `[ptr+8]=0` (empty). cp31 adds `materialize_char_array` (in
`handle_java_trampoline`'s result path, scoped to `[C`): it allocates a guest data
block `{u32 len, u16 chars[len]}` and points the object's `+0x08` at it — the exact
layout RE'd above. Behaviour-confirmed: the `[C` return is materialised, and the block
is correct (logged `char[] len=10 text="LOADING..."`; unit-tested via
`write_char_array_block`).

*(cp31's note that the glyph loop "never enters" was wrong — an `lr` mis-calc; cp32
shows it runs.)* *cp32 target (one line):* find why the glyph loop, once entered,
draws no glyphs.

**cp32 — char-array marshalling confirmed working; glyph render is the real gap.**
Re-traced with corrected `lr`s. The colour "gate" at `0x10298` is **not** a gate:
`g.vtable[ref21]()` = `Graphics.getColor()I` (id 21); both branches (`== 0x00ffffff`
and the `setColor(~c)` else-path) **fall through to `0x102c0`**, so the glyph loop is
always entered. And it **runs**: the loop body's `import 0x55` at `0x102d0` fires
`lr=0x102dc` **30×** (3 frames × 10 chars), reading `data=0x49048000`, `len=10`, chars
`0x4c='L'`… — i.e. `materialize_char_array` works end-to-end and the loop consumes
"LOADING...". (`register_platform_object` readback confirmed `[obj+8]=data`, `[data]=10`.)
What's missing is **glyph drawing**, traced in cp33 below.

**cp33 — the glyph-draw fn runs but has no font image (platform/font gap).** The
glyph-draw fn `@0x109b4` *is* called per char (each char's `0xb(a1=char, a2=x)` lookup
then the fn's body fire). It branches on its first arg `r6` (the font image): at
`0x10b1c cmp r6,#0; 0x10b2c bne 0x10b44`, `r6 != 0` → `r6.vtable[r2]()` (the blit /
drawImage), `r6 == 0` → `import 0x22` (a no-op fallback). Measured: every char takes the
**`r6 == 0`** path — `import 0x22` fires at `lr=0x10b40` once per char — so **no
drawImage is ever issued**. (The earlier `getColor`/clip branches are *not* the skip;
they all reach the glyph fn.) Root cause **(C): the font glyph image is absent** (`r6 ==
0`) — the bitmap-font sheet the AOT expects to blit each glyph from is not present
guest-side, so the draw falls back to a no-op. char data is correct ("LOADING..." is
read); the glyphs just have no font to draw from.

This is a font/image-marshalling task (its own checkpoint), not a one-liner.

**cp34 — glyph blit mechanism RE'd; contract not yet complete → cp35 plan.** The
glyph-draw fn `@0x109b4` has two paths, gated on its font-image arg `r6`:
- **`r6 != 0`** → `g.drawImage(font_sheet, …)` with **`src_x = (char - 0x21) * 10`,
  `width = 10`** (`0x10ac0`: `r3 = char - 0x21; r4 = r3 * 10`) — i.e. a fixed-pitch
  10px ASCII glyph grid blitted from a font sheet (`char 0x21='!'` is grid origin).
- **`r6 == 0`** (measured) → `import 0x22(a0=0, a1=0x11264, a2=x)`. `a1=0x11264` is a
  **.text thunk → `0x10fb0`** (an app native fn that itself calls `getInstance`/imports),
  i.e. `0x22` here is a **carried-code/callback shape** (a1 = a function pointer), and
  wie no-ops it → the native font render never runs. x advances +6 per char (14/20/26…).

So the per-char render is *not* a one-liner: with no font image (`r6==0`), the app falls
to a native font path (`0x22` → fn `0x10fb0`) that wie doesn't run. **Two unknowns block
a confident impl** (so no code this checkpoint, per the "no half-guess" rule):
1. *Why `r6==0`.* Statically `r6` traces to the `Graphics` arg (≠0), but it's measured
   as 0 at the blit — needs a guest-register read (the static trace can't resolve a
   mid-fn reassignment). Determines path (i) JVM-image vs (ii) native.
2. *What `0x22`/`0x10fb0` actually do* — is `0x22` "run carried code a1" (cp23 showed
   replaying carried code can be inert), or a blit primitive? And does `0x10fb0` render
   a glyph to the back-buffer, and from what font data?

*cp35 plan:* (a) guest-register probe at the `0x22` site to fix `r6`/the font image; (b)
RE `0x10fb0`; (c) implement the confirmed path. (Resolved in cp35 below.)

**cp35 — both unknowns resolved; the font path is platform-gated (§7), STOP.** A
one-shot `dump_reg_stack` probe at the per-char `import 0x22` (filtered `a1=0x11264,
a2=14`) settled both:
- **Unknown 1 (corrected cp33/cp34):** `r6` is **not** the font image — `R6 = 0x48840550
  = g (the back-buffer Graphics, ≠0)`. The font image is `import 0x22`'s **a0**
  (`R0 = [singleton.field5] = 0`), measured **0** every char (with `R7=0`, `SB=x`,
  `SL=char`, e.g. `0x4c='L'`). So the **font sheet image is absent/null**, and the glyph
  draw falls back to the native `0x22` path.
- **Unknown 2:** `0x10fb0` (the `0x22` a1 fn) is **`strb` into an object's field array**
  (`[r2+4..+0xb]`, 8 bytes) with **no `Graphics`/drawImage vtable call** — i.e.
  bookkeeping, not an on-screen blit. So the native path renders nothing (cp23-style
  inert), even if run.
- **No font load happens.** A full `debug` run shows `Image.createImage` called **once**
  — the 240×320 **back-buffer** — and **no** `createImage`/`getResource` for a font
  sheet anywhere. So path (i) JVM-image has no load site in the reachable run, and path
  (ii) native is inert.

**Classification: platform-side (§7).** Either the font sheet would be loaded by a later
init step the game never reaches (a.run is one-shot — same per-frame-drive gap as the
render driver), or the font is an ez-i-native resource the `0x22`/`0x10fb0` runtime draws
(which wie doesn't emulate). Both are the §7 missing piece, not an app-side one-liner;
forcing a font would be a guess. *cp36 (one line):* once the per-frame drive (§7) runs,
re-check whether the game then loads the font sheet via `createImage` (→ path i becomes
implementable, `g.drawImage(sheet, src_x=(char-0x21)*10, w=10)`); until then the title
text is blocked on the same §7 gate as the rest of the live render state.

### The single missing answer (for the maintainer)

With that, the connection is: on each wie paint tick, invoke the registered object's
per-frame entry with a Graphics, then map its flush to wie's `present`/screen blit —
all from the `wie_lgt` / `LgtJvmShared` side, without touching shared classes.

cp28 narrows what this drive must accomplish: wie's paint→`Graphics`→back-buffer→flush
path already works (forcing one gate flag made `o.paint` draw to screen). The missing
piece is purely **advancing the game state machine each frame** so the per-card render
flags like `o.g` get set.

**cp36 — driving the state methods from wie does NOT substitute for the ez-i tick
(confirmed).** Tested whether wie can just call the state-advance methods each frame
instead of the ez-i runtime:
- *Correction to cp27:* the `o.g` writer is **not** the registered virtual `o.k()V`.
  `o.k @0xda7f8` is a short method (returns at `0xda85c`, no `+0x18`/`o.g` store) — it
  copies a singleton field. The real `o.g` writer is an **unregistered helper
  `@0xda870`** (not in any class's method table): `getInstance(o)` → reset `o.g=0` (and
  siblings) → conditionally `o.g=1` at `0xdb240`.
- *Experiment (reverted):* drove both, 3× each, reading `o.g` after each call. `o.k()`
  (JVM `invoke_virtual`) → `o.g` stays `0`. `fn@0xda870` (native `run_function`) → `o.g`
  stays `0` too: the helper runs and resets `o.g=0`, but its conditional `o.g=1` branch
  (`0xdb240`) is **not taken** — that branch depends on accumulated game state
  (load-complete / timer / input / card-transition), not satisfiable by calling the
  method in isolation.
- *Conclusion:* **a single JVM/native method drive cannot advance the state** — `o.g=1`
  needs the whole game loop's accumulated conditions, which is exactly the ez-i per-frame
  drive. So substituting wie method-calls for the ez-i tick is ruled out; the §7 entry
  (the real per-frame driver the ez-i runtime invokes) is the single remaining gate, the
  same one that gates the live render state, `o.g`, and the font load. Maintainer path.

**cp37 — the registered "carried code" is one-time INIT, not the per-frame step;
sustained drive of it is inert (experiment, reverted).** Directly attacked the §7 gate by
synthesizing an ez-i per-frame drive in `wie_lgt` (LGT-Java-gated): capture the carried-code
pointer the app registers, then invoke it once per ~frame from a spawned task paced by
`system.sleep` (so wie's clock advances and the MIDP paint/event loop interleaves). New facts,
all RE-confirmed against the app binary (`binary.mod`; 배틀몬스터 **is** the reference app —
`.text 0x1000..0xe7800`, `.data 0x1400000`, matching this doc):

- *AOT method bodies are ARM (A32), not Thumb.* The init entrypoint is entered Thumb
  (`entry+1`), but every class method / carried-code body is 32-bit ARM (`mov ip,sp;
  stmfd sp!,{…,lr}` prologue). `run_function` selects mode by `address & 1`, so the even
  code pointers run as ARM (consistent with methods already working).
- *The registered callback is a single entry `0x1ad4`.* Runtime trace of `a.run`: it calls
  `0x55(obj=0x48840020, a1=0x1ad4, 0)`, `0x56(this=0x48840010, a1=0x1ad4, 0)`,
  `0x57(this, 0x1ad4, 0)`, `0x21(newobj=0x48840550, 0x1ad4, 0)` — **all four carry the same
  code pointer `a1=0x1ad4`**, with distinct `.data` stash slots in `a3` (`0x140467c/8c/9c`).
  `0x1ad4` is `b 0x1a24`.
- *`0x1a24` is straight-line INIT, arg-ignoring and idempotent (full disasm).* It does
  `getInstance(0xa)` (immediately `mov r0,#0xa`, discarding any incoming arg), `bl 0x1908`,
  then unconditionally `str`s constants into the singleton's field array
  (`[+0x24]=0, [+0x34]=1, [+0x38]=1, [+0x3c]=…, [+0x48]=3, [+0x44/0x4c..0x60]=0`) and
  returns. **No conditional branch, no per-frame state read.** Re-running it just re-sets
  the same constants — semantically a one-time "start/init" callback (the ez-i analog of
  the clet `startClet`), **not** a frame step.
- *Experiment result (reverted):* the loop captured `0x1ad4` and drove it every ~33 ms
  with no error — and the screen **stayed black** (`content:false`, 1 paint). So a *sustained*
  drive of the registered carried code is **inert** (extends cp23's one-shot finding), and
  driving init code per-frame is also semantically wrong (it would re-init a progressed
  game). Reverted: the carried code is not the per-frame entry, so capturing/driving it is
  dead weight and a (small) regression risk to the other AOT games.

*Refined classification.* The per-frame entry the ez-i runtime invokes is **not** any
pointer the app hands to `0x55/0x56/0x57` (those are its init/lifecycle callbacks). Per §7
it is the runtime's invocation of a **method on the registered native object** (the unbound
`0x21` object `0x48840550`) through the **ez-i native-displayable vtable ABI** — which lives
in the LGT platform, **not in the app binary**, so its slot/signature cannot be derived from
`binary.mod` and choosing one would be a guess (forbidden). cp37 thus narrows the §7 question
to its sharpest form below and **rules out the most natural non-guess avenue** (drive the
registered callback). Genuinely maintainer/platform-ABI-gated.

*cp38 starting point (one line):* find the per-frame entry by locating who, in a real LGT
device trace, calls into the `0xda870→0xdb240` (`o.g`) writer chain — i.e. RE the LGT/ez-i
platform's native-displayable dispatch (the absent caller), not the app; the app side is
exhausted.
